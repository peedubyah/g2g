            <em>
             We investigated an issue where the surge from Enhanced Charged Bolts was happening too frequently when enemies were tightly stacked together, which caused performance issues. We also found that the surge damage was doing less damage than intended while the Piercing Static aspect was equipped. While fixing those two issues (see bug fixes below), it was decided that a 50% buff to the surge damage would compensate for reducing how often it procs when enemies are stacked together.

             Developer’s Note:
            </strong>
            <em>
             Previously, if you compared an item’s stats and it had a value appear twice (such as Cooldown Reduction,) it would display those two different values individually. We have now updated this to combine those individual values to only display one value, making it easier to compare stats across items.

             Anyone who has killed Echo of Lilith in any season will receive a Resplendent Spark this season. In future seasons, you will have to defeat her again to get one. This implementation is to retroactively reward players who have defeated Echo of Lilith this season, but did not receive a Resplendent Spark. For players that have yet to defeat Echo of Lilith this season, defeating her will still grant you a Resplendent Spark.

            For controller players that attempt to move and cast an ability but lack the resource for that ability, you will continue to move that direction until you have enough of your class's resource. At which point, you will stop moving and cast that ability. This has been fixed so that the player will stop moving even when they don't have enough resources to cast.

            <em>
             Some items, Legendary Aspects, Passives, Paragon bonuses, and Skills displayed bugs that allowed players to gain more power than intended when you equipped and then unequipped them. We believe these interactions lead to a worse experience for all players, as it creates a stigma that these bugs must be exploited to reach new levels of power. The bug fixes below address all known instances of this issue.

            </strong>
            <em>
             Uber Unique items are highly sought after. With Season of Blood, we introduced target-farming Uber Unique Items with Uber Duriel to gives players another source of acquiring this type of item. However, we want to give players increased autonomy in obtaining their desired Uber Unique by addressing feedback that expressed how acquiring duplicate or undesired Uber Unique Items lessens that feeling of triumph. A new system empowers players to make use of duplicate and undesired Uber Unique items by salvaging them for a new resource which can be used to eventually craft an Uber Unique of their choosing. Additionally, the chance for Uber Unique Items to drop everywhere but in Uber Duriel encounters has been increased.

             In a future patch, we’ll make an additional improvement to the Vampiric affix. Projectile attacks from monsters—like a Khazra's thrown spear—will gain a visual effect when they are imbued with the Vampiric affix. This will make it easier to identify which projectiles can heal the monster.

             We have noticed players tended to use their Pearls of Warding for fighting Echo of Malphas instead of on Zoltun’s Warding. We are adding in Igneous Cores—a new item used solely to summon Malphas instead of Pearls—so players don’t have to choose between extra protection in the Vaults or fighting the boss. Additionally, we have made the fight against Malphas more difficult but also increased the rewards it provides.

            <em>
             It’s important to us that when a player chooses to fully invest in a Skill, the payoff is immense. In pursuit of this goal, several of our new Unique and Legendary items are targeting Skills that have yet to reach their full potential. We’re excited to see what players accomplish with our new Unique items for Barbarian’s Rend, Druid’s Lightning Storm, and Sorcerer’s Meteor. We’re also targeting some pressing issues for each Class. Necromancers with Cult Leader should see their Minions strike a bit harder, Barbarians shouldn’t feel that 3 Shouts are a requirement for their success, and Sorceresses applying Vulnerable with Lightning Spear should open new build opportunities. There are also Class updates to items and Skills that are underperforming, such as the Rogue’s Ranged Unique Items, and the Necromancer’s Golem.

For more details, seehere.Pets are now available in-game. Aiding with Material and Item pick-up, a Quest is now available on log-in that grants a Pet upon completion.Tempering Manuals on the ground now have their tooltip name reduced to start with "Manual" to quickly distinguish what the item is.Duplicate or obsolete Tempering Manuals, manuals the player has already unlocked or has a higher rarity version of, will no longer drop.Completing the Capstone Dungeon will now grant a Nightmare Dungeon Sigil.Bug FixesAccessibilityFixed multiple issues where the Screen Reader did not function properly for certain parts of the Tempering and Masterworking menus.Fixed an issue where the Screen Reader did not announce the description for the Pit Obelisk.Fixed an issue where the Screen Reader did not announce the tooltip for Viewing possible affixes.Fixed an issue where the Screen Reader did not identify required World Tier values in crafting material tooltips.User Experience and User InterfaceFixed an issue where linking certain Items in chat wouldn\'t display properly.Fixed an issue where the Gauntlet score screen would display "You Have Ranked Up!" regardless of whether or not the player actually ranked up.Fixed an issue where known Tempering Recipes of the same type were counting towards the total of all learned recipes, which could cause the total number of known recipes displayed to be more than the maximum.Fixed an issue where the Reset Masterwork ranks window could not be closed with the Escape key.Fixed an issue where the Greater Affix icon did not display in the trade window.Fixed an issue where the number displayed for Thorns inherited by Minions was much higher than it actually was.Fixed an issue where Withdraw-Only items from the Seasonal migration Stash could randomly appear directly into the player\'s Inventory.Fixed an issue where icons for Greater Affixes and Masterworking did not appear when inspecting another player.Fixed an issue where Controller navigation was inconsistent in the Stable menu.Fixed an issue where additional monsters spawned during Boss encounters in The Pit would display as red dots on the minimap similar to monsters marked as objectives.Fixed an issue where the effect denoting active Helltide in the map could malfunction if the player was in a dungeon when a new Helltide began.GameplayFixed an issue where the player\'s character could become invisible and uncontrollable in rare circumstances while Bloodmarked and Mounted.Fixed an issue where the Cursed Chest event in Domhainne Tunnels could fail to complete if the last enemy was killed right as the timer expired.Fixed an issue where the player could get stuck in the death screen if they were killed with 0 revives left in a Nightmare Dungeon while in a party.Fixed an issue where the Mastery objective for the Rupture Dungeon Event could not be achieved.Fixed an issue where triggers of the Elemental Surge Tempering affix could unintentionally break Stealth.Fixed an issue where spawn points for the Blood Maiden were sometimes further away than intended.Fixed an issue where you couldn’t interact with the Pit Obelisk after Resetting Dungeons.Fixed an issue where Rare spawn monsters could still drop crafting materials, such as crushed beast bones and grave dust.Fixed an issue where the Druid’s Bloodhowl did not benefit from the Bold Chieftain\'s Aspect when combined with Nighthowler\'s Aspect.Fixed an issue where the visual effect for Upheaval when used with the Hellhammer did not match the damage\'s area of effect.Fixed an issue where the Spider Caller could not spawn in Sirocco Caverns, which would block progression.Fixed an issue where certain affixes were scaling in unintended ways.Developer’s Note:This change means the following affixes will now scale properly. For almost all of these, the issue applies only to the duration of the affix. Duration wasn\'t meant to scale, but it incorrectly scaled with upgrades through Masterworking. Any changes beyond that will be listed below.Unique AffixesScoundrel\'s Kiss - +X% Attack Speed for 4 Seconds After Dodging an Attack.Blood Artisan\'s Cuirass - +X% Damage for 4 Seconds After Picking up a Blood Orb.Fists of Fate - Lucky Hit: Up to a 10% Chance to Gain X% Damage for 4 Seconds.

           <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
             <span>
              Reduced the frequency of boss affixes so they don't overlap.

            <em>
             We investigated an issue where the surge from Enhanced Charged Bolts was happening too frequently when enemies were tightly stacked together, which caused performance issues. We also found that the surge damage was doing less damage than intended while the Piercing Static aspect was equipped. While fixing those two issues (see bug fixes below), it was decided that a 50% buff to the surge damage would compensate for reducing how often it procs when enemies are stacked together.

             Previously, if you compared an item’s stats and it had a value appear twice (such as Cooldown Reduction,) it would display those two different values individually. We have now updated this to combine those individual values to only display one value, making it easier to compare stats across items.

             Some items, Legendary Aspects, Passives, Paragon bonuses, and Skills displayed bugs that allowed players to gain more power than intended when you equipped and then unequipped them. We believe these interactions lead to a worse experience for all players, as it creates a stigma that these bugs must be exploited to reach new levels of power.

            <em>
             Uber Unique items are highly sought after. With Season of Blood, we introduced target-farming Uber Unique Items with Uber Duriel to gives players another source of acquiring this type of item. However, we want to give players increased autonomy in obtaining their desired Uber Unique by addressing feedback that expressed how acquiring duplicate or undesired Uber Unique Items lessens that feeling of triumph. A new system empowers players to make use of duplicate and undesired Uber Unique items by salvaging them for a new resource which can be used to eventually craft an Uber Unique of their choosing. Additionally, the chance for Uber Unique Items to drop everywhere but in Uber Duriel encounters has been increased.

            </strong>
            <em>
             In a future patch, we’ll make an additional improvement to the Vampiric affix. Projectile attacks from monsters—like a Khazra's thrown spear—will gain a visual effect when they are imbued with the Vampiric affix. This will make it easier to identify which projectiles can heal the monster.

             We have noticed players tended to use their Pearls of Warding for fighting Echo of Malphas instead of on Zoltun’s Warding. We are adding in Igneous Cores—a new item used solely to summon Malphas instead of Pearls—so players don’t have to choose between extra protection in the Vaults or fighting the boss. Additionally, we have made the fight against Malphas more difficult but also increased the rewards it provides.

             Developer’s Note:
            </strong>
            <em>
             It’s important to us that when a player chooses to fully invest in a Skill, the payoff is immense. In pursuit of this goal, several of our new Unique and Legendary items are targeting Skills that have yet to reach their full potential. We’re excited to see what players accomplish with our new Unique items for Barbarian’s Rend, Druid’s Lightning Storm, and Sorcerer’s Meteor. We’re also targeting some pressing issues for each Class. Necromancers with Cult Leader should see their Minions strike a bit harder, Barbarians shouldn’t feel that 3 Shouts are a requirement for their success, and Sorceresses applying Vulnerable with Lightning Spear should open new build opportunities. There are also Class updates to items and Skills that are underperforming, such as the Rogue’s Ranged Unique Items, and the Necromancer’s Golem.
